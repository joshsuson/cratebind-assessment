# Getting Started

Once you've cloned the site you will want to run 

### `npm install`

This will install the dependencies for create react app. Outside of those I didn't install any other dependencies or packages.

## Running the App

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## More Info

I only used vanilla CSS. All the styles will be found in the App.css file. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out.
